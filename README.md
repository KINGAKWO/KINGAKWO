# 👋 Hi, I'm King Akwo

I'm a Python developer in training, currently taking the Microsoft Automation & Scripting with Python course on Coursera. I'm building a strong foundation in scripting, command-line automation, virtual environments, and real-world task automation using Python.

## 🚀 My Current Focus

- Automating tasks with Python scripts
- Building CLI tools with `argparse` and `sys`
- Using `venv` to manage environments
- Integrating Python with shell commands


## 🧰 Tools I Use

- Python, Git, Bash, PowerShell
- VS Code, Jupyter
- GitHub for sharing everything I learn

## 🎯 2025 Goal

📌 Land my first Python developer role and contribute to open-source automation projects.
