# 👋 Hi, I'm King Akwo  

💻 **Python Developer | Data Enthusiast | Automation & AI Explorer**

I’m a passionate Python developer currently transitioning from challenge-based learning into **real-world project development** — applying automation, data analysis, and AI integration to build portfolio-ready applications.  

I recently earned the **Microsoft Python Development Career Certificate** and I’m now advancing through the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**, while continuing to strengthen my development workflow through hands-on projects.
